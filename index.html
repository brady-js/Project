        <p>A computer is an electronic machine that stores, retrieves, and processes data. Computers are told how to process, store, or retrieve this data by software or programs.</p>

        <p>In this technical documentation page, you will learn about various different types of hardware components of computers. You will also learn about some of the software and operating systems that are currently out.</p>

        <p>Computers are made up of various types of hardware. In order to makeup a fully functioning computer, you will need the following: 
          <ul>
            <li>CPU</li>
            <li>GPU</li>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <li>Monitor or Display</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>With all of this amazing hardware, we can make a computer. We can then move on to installing software onto the computer in order to use software or programs to tell our computer what to do.</p>

        <p>There are various operating systems on the market as of today. The most commonly used operating system among computers is <em>Microsoft Windows</em>. However, there are many other great operating systems that one can choose from.</p>

        <p>Some other operating systems that are great are <em>macOS</em>, <em>Ubuntu</em>, and <em>Linux</em>. However, some of these operating systems are not for ideal for every day use depending on what you plan to do with your computer.</p>

        <p>Software is able to be installed onto these computers and run ontop of the operating system. All of these operating systems and different software types involve using <em>Code</em>. Code tells the computer how to display software, websites, operating systems. Think of coding as language but for computers. There are different types of code. Some common types of code are as follows:

          <ul>
            <li>HTML (example:<code>!DOCTYPE html</code>)</li>
            <li>CSS (example:<code>body {}</code>)</li>
            <li>JavaScript (example:<code>Math.min()</code> )</li>
            <li>Python (example:<code>class Point:</code>)</li>
            <li>C# (example:<code>return "large"</code>)</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

        <header>Common Issues</header>
        <p>Some common issues with computers can include hardware being incompatible with other hardware, outdated drivers or software, damaged or corrupt data, or faulty hardware.</p>

        <p>Some of these problems can be easier to fix than others, it may be as simple as turning your PC off then turning it back on. However, some issues can be more, complex, and may require changing hardware.</p>

      <section id="Troubleshoot" class="main-section">
        <header>Troubleshoot</header>
        <p>The best way to troubleshoot your computer is to research the problem. If you are given an error, try using <em>Google</em> to search for the error code to find it's meaning. Most websites will give you a list with troubleshooting tips depending on your issue.</p>

        <p>Some issues may not be as easy to troubleshoot on your own. At that point, you may want to consider calling some form of technical support, or contacting a PC repair shop near you to see if they can figure out what is going on. Make sure you always research your issue before contacting any support, and make sure you research any repair shops you might go to in order to make sure they have good business practices.</p>
